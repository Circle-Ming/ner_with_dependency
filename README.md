## Dependency-Guided LSTM-CRF Model for Named Entity Recognition

Codebase for the upcoming paper "Dependency-Guided LSTM-CRF for Named Entity Recognition" in EMNLP 2019.

### Requirements
* PyTorch 1.1
* Python 3

### Usage

Detailed documentation is coming soon.


### Quick Update

#### Preprocessing
Many people are asking for the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset. 
I understand that it is hard to get the correct split as in previous work (Chiu and Nichols, 2016; Li et al., 2017; Ghaddar and Langlais, 2018;).
If you want to get the correct split, you can refere to a guide [here](https://github.com/allanj/pytorch_lstmcrf/blob/master/docs/benchmark.md) where 
I summarize how to preprocess the OntoNotes dataset.

#### Without Preprocessing
If you have the LDC license for OntoNotes, please send the proof (e.g., screenshot) to me and I will be happy to share the 
preprocessed OntoNotes dataset with you.
